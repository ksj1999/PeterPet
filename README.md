## About the Project  
**Duration:** September 24, 2023 â€“ November 17, 2023  

PeterPet is a collaborative project between **Inha University** and **Advantech**, developed as part of the *Advantech Innoworks* program.  
The platform is an **integrated pet care management service** that leverages **AIoT technology** and **WISE-PaaS** services to monitor the condition of multiple pets in real time.

## Key Features  

- **Integrated Control System**  
  Provides centralized management of basic information and on-site environmental data for pet care companies. Includes monitoring dashboards, control panels, and alert functions.  

- **AI BCS Classifier**  
  Uses an AI model trained on dog health data (AI Hub dataset) to assess petsâ€™ Body Condition Scores (BCS) and identify obesity levels.  

- **Real-Time Pet Monitoring**  
  Harness sensors attached to pets collect activity and environmental data. Both caretakers and pet owners can monitor conditions via a dashboard, reducing anxiety and improving convenience.  

- **Automatic Feeding System**  
  Machine learning models analyze pet activity and health data to dynamically adjust feeding portions, enabling personalized automatic feeding.
